**Distance**: 900mi, ~13 hours

## Why Dollywood?

* Lots of fun for kids
* Tennessee has a lot of nature to offer
* Could make scenic stops in Little Rock, Memphis, or Nashville
* Could plan a meet up with Tim and Stephanie!
* Driveable - able to have our car as a home base.

## Why NOT Dollywood?

* Really far - would likely take two days to drive just one way
* We love Dolly Parton, but wer're not exactly superfans.
* There's likely another great kid-oriented theme park closer to home
* Would deal with the trappings of any theme park in the summer
* Our two younger kids are a bit young for the theme park

### Cabins

Cabins seems to be the preferred lodging for Dollywood visitiors.
There is a whole section of the Dollywood website devoted to them.

Expect to spend $3,000-4,000 for a good cabin experience.

I personally would enjoy staying in a cabin,
further embracing the outdoorsy Smoky Mountain aesthetic.

Typical theme park faire: lots of:

* Roller coasters
* Kids rides
* Food
* Dolly memorabilia
* Playgrounds
* Shows
* Crafts

There's also live bird viewings (eagles, etc).

3 day pass for family: **$700**
