**Distance**: 900mi, ~13 hours

## Why Dollywood?

* Lots of fun for kids
* Tennessee has a lot of nature to offer
* Could make scenic stops in Little Rock or Memphis
* Could plan a meet up with Tim and Stephanie!
* Driveable - able to have our car as a home base.

## Why NOT Dollywood?

* Really far - would likely take two days to drive just one way
* We love Dolly Parton, but wer're not exactly superfans.
* There's likely a great kid-oriented theme park closer to home
