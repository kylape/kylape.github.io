![Downtown Houston](houston.jpeg)

**Distance**: 360mi, ~3h 45m drive

## Why Houston?

* Easy drive
* Tons to do - big city
* Close to beach
* Decent urban core - perhaps won't have to drive
* Visit some of our Houston friends!
* Influencer opportunities
* True crime hotspots
* Underground food courts
* Diverse food

## Why NOT Houston?

* Super humid - armpit of Texas
* Traffic will be miserable (but won't it be bad everywhere?)
* Lack of really unique experiences - why not just go to Dallas for the "big city" experience?

## Getting Around

Houston is notorious for its massive highways, so we will undoubtedly be in the car often.

That said, staying in a hotel downtown and choosing activities nearby *could* allow us to ditch the car a couple of the days.

Houston does have [public transit](https://www.ridemetro.org).  The bus routes go pretty much everywhere, but the rail lines are very limited, only going to the museum district.

## Hotels

### Marriott Marquis

This hotel is right downtown and has the fancy lazy river on its roof.

**Price**: $481/room/night x 5 nights x 2 rooms = $4,810

### Hampton Inn

Downtown, but much cheaper.

**Price**: $238/room/night x 5 nights x 2 rooms = $2,380

### Crowne Plaza

Even cheaper, but not downtown.  It's near the intersection of I-10 (Katy Freeway) and I-610.

**Price**: $136/room/night x 5 nights x 2 rooms = $1,360

## Attractions

### Astros game
While we aren't baseball fans, this would be a fun outing that the kids would likely enjoy, just for the food and atmosphere.

**Location**: Minute Maid Park, Northwest downtown

### [Buffalo Bayou Park](https://buffalobayou.org/location/buffalo-bayou-park/)
It's a park on the Buffalo Bayou (a kind of river?).  Nothing that seems extraordinary about the park, but it's a nice one.

**Location**: 2.5 miles west of downtown

## Memorial Park

Another park, but it's huge.
There is a [conservation group][1] that seems to promote and preserve its natural beauty.
Biking, skating, all the typical park activities.

**Location**: 5.4 miles west of downtown

at least enough to make it a day trip.
